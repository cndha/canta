# Carta
Carta is our midterm project built during our time at Lighthouse Labs. Carta uses Google Maps API and Geocoding API to allow users to drop pins and create a themed map of their favourite places. The database hosts information about the user's created maps, favourited maps, and maps they have collaborated on with others.
