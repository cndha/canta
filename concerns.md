index.ejs paths are confusing

css styling is hitting a roadblock because of the sass/.gitkeep /style directory.
app.js wont connect to the html scripts
jquery
and map api's wont GET because the server isn't routing.

cant modularize because none of the paths are attaching themselves so I'm stuck styling on a single page

we need to reconsider if this needs to be a single page or multi page app

need a better road map to figure out how we can get things to connect.
